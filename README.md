# /r/SpaceWX Reddit Theme
This is a reddit theme under development for the /r/SpaceWX subreddit

## Build
A SASS compiler is required to build the CSS. Alternatively, pre-compiled CSS is in the `css` directory, however it is minified.

## Pull Requests
I :heart: pull requests! However, please make sure you made the edits to the **SASS** files and not the minified CSS output (do however include a minified CSS output in your PR). Also please do not use `!important` in any of your rules. Finally, be sure you place the styles in the right place, if a new SASS file is needed feel free to make one.
